        <p>I read a New York Times article named "The Secret History
        of Women in Coding," and learned many things. I thought about this when 
        the author, Vannevar Bush, mentioned Babbage and not Ada Lovelace. 
        As well as when he mentioned that there will be a "whole roomful of 
        girls" delivering instructions and data to the machines. This reminded
        me of how the article mentioned in the beginning there were <em>
        only </em> women in computing. Another thing that striked me was that
        I don't think <em>anybody</em> could have predicted what was to come
        out next. Specifically, how far technology would have actually advanced.

        I think the thing that scared me the most was reading that ISPs could 
        potentially limit the websites you can use. They could ultimately charge
        you different prices for different "packages." The packages being the 
        websites you could have access to. As Tim Berners-Lee suggested that 
        would compromise the promise of universitality the Web is supposed to
        have kept.
